# DSA Revision in Java (Striver's SDE Sheet) 🚀

## About This Repository
This repository tracks my active, daily revision of Data Structures and Algorithms. I am currently revisiting Striver's A2Z / SDE Sheet and meticulously porting my previous 300+ C++ solutions into **Java**. 

I am doing this to perfectly align my algorithmic problem-solving skills with my core development stack as a Java Backend Developer (Spring Boot, Kafka). 

## Structure
Solutions are heavily commented with time and space complexities, and categorized by core data structures and algorithmic patterns:
* `📁 arrays/`
* `📁 sorting/`
* *(More topics being added daily as I progress through the sheet)*

## File Naming Convention
Files are named to easily identify the platform and the problem: `[Platform]_[ProblemName].java` (e.g., `LC_TwoSum.java` for LeetCode). Each file contains:
1. A direct link to the problem.
2. A detailed explanation of the approach.
3. The fully optimized Java code.
