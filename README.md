# DSA Revision in Java (Striver's SDE Sheet) 🚀

## About This Repository
This repository tracks my active, daily revision of Data Structures and Algorithms. I am currently revisiting Striver's A2Z / SDE Sheet and meticulously porting my previous 300+ C++ solutions into **Java**.

I am doing this to align my algorithmic problem-solving skills with my core development stack as a **Java Backend Developer (Spring Boot, Kafka, scalable systems)** while strengthening my preparation for backend and product-based company interviews.

This revision focuses on:
- Pattern recognition and problem-solving intuition
- Clean, optimized, and production-style Java code
- Strong conceptual clarity
- Interview-oriented explanations

---

## Structure
Solutions are heavily commented with:
- Approach and key insights  
- Edge cases  
- Time and space complexities  
- Pattern identification  

They are categorized by core data structures and algorithmic patterns:

* 📁 `arrays/`
* 📁 `sorting/`
* 📁 `binarysearch/`
* *(More topics are being added daily as I progress through the sheet)*

## File Naming Convention
Files are named to easily identify the platform and the problem: `[Platform]_[ProblemName].java` (e.g., `LC_TwoSum.java` for LeetCode). 
Each file contains:
1. A direct link to the original problem.
2. Pattern and key insight.
3. A detailed explanation of the approach.
4. Optimized and clean Java implementation.
5. Time and space complexity analysis.

## Current Focus
🔍 **Binary Search Pattern Mastery**

This phase includes:
- Classic binary search
- Lower and upper bound
- Rotated sorted arrays
- Binary search on answer
- Search space reduction
- Interview-level variations

The goal is to build strong intuition and speed in solving complex problems efficiently.
